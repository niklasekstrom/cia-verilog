# Implementation of 8250 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) in Verilog

I believe this should be mostly working, but it hasn't been tested so it also most likely contains a few bugs.

Compiles in Quartus and uses 483 logic elements in an Intel MAX II CPLD.

The Time of Day clock (TOD) feature could probably be removed or significantly simplified to save LEs.
